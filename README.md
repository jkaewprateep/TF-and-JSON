# TF-and-JSON
JSON communication message with Tensorflow

🧸💬 Development environment preparation, Python virtual environment with bash command integration. In development environments, you may have requirements to develop the same library with multiple versions in the version control step of CI/CD software development or need to perform development with different Kernel and cloud accounts to help with virtual environment setup. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ For network communications binary message is ready for pop message integration or you can perform the same task using local library formats. </br>

🐐💬 Anaconda console for virtual environment management, integration with online templates, and local virtual environment or performed by activated virtual in Python or parallel desktop in multiple development platforms. </br>
🦭💬 In some machine learning remote distribution will only receive communication in binary format or require installed Tensorflow at the destination, there are Tensorflow lite, networks conversion, or direct communication using IC circuits. </br>
🐯💬 Culture INFO, by communication needs to be performed on both terminals with the same information requirements as agreed, process, or compressed may add overhead to the message in the manner of terminals having the same message information with their performance-activated method. </br>

🦁💬 A virtual environment is identified by its access level to data sources and executable on an object. The level access authority can activate and execute on the target destination, or they can perform restore and tracking. Still, the results from execution on the primary are not a virtual environment. </br>
🦭💬 They are utility help for managing data information and backup restore with the ability to perform tasks like installing of multiple configuration sets on the same OS and data resources. </br>
